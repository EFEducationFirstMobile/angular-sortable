I am trying to make the best sortable directive for Angular.js, your contribution is very welcome :)

I figured out that when we detect that the order should be updated, instead of proceeding to complex DOM manipulations, updating the referenced array would produce the same result, the "Angular" way (this is my personal opinion)...
